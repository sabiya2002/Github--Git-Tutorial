-- <h3> <i>  Version Control System is a tools that helps to track change in code</i> </h3>

 <h2> Git is like a version control system that records every detail of your code changes. It helps you track, update, delete, and maintain all the small pieces of information about your work.

Analogy: Git as a Bank Account
Imagine Mr. Sharma opens a savings account at SBI Bank of India. He is a salaried employee working as a data scientist at a company. His salary is ₹40,000, and he deposits ₹3,000 when he opens the account.

Later, he sets up automatic transactions for his electricity bill, rent, and other payments. Each transaction is recorded in his bank statement, allowing him to track his expenses daily without manually writing them down in a notebook or phone.Similarly, Git tracks all your code changes automatically, just like a bank tracks transactions.

Depositing money = Committing code (Saving your progress)

Checking bank statements = Viewing Git history (Tracking changes)

Undoing a transaction = Reverting to a previous commit (Fixing mistakes)

Setting up auto-payments = Automating deployments (Streamlining workflow)

This way, Git helps developers save, update, and manage their work efficiently, just like a bank helps customers manage their finances.
